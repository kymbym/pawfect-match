# Pawfect Match

Pawfect Match aims to be the go-to platform to connect people with various animal welfare agencies and organizations, helping everyone (humans and dogs alike) find their pawfect match.

**A unified platform for pet adoption**

With Pawfect Match, organizations can create their organization profile and upload their pets for adoption. When users sign in, they can search for pets across multiple agencies all in one place.

**Stay connect with favorites**

Instead of a regular profile and a carousel of photos, Pawfect Match recreates Instagram by giving each pet a dedicated profile page with photos in a grid that can be updated by their providers.

User who are interested in certain pets can "follow" them and check back in for updates on their pets' shelter activities.

Whenever users are ready to arrange for a viewing, they can simply fill up an appointment form that will go straight to the relevant providers.

This has been a group project embarked by Kymmy and Carmen in fulfillment of the third project to build a full-stack web app.
